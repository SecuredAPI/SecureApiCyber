# Secured Api Cyber Security Project
# Project title: SecureAPI
# Building a Secure API for Web Security


API security is important because businesses use APIs to connect services and to transfer data, so a hacked API can lead to a data breach. According to Gartner, 90% of web-enabled applications will have more attack surface area in exposed APIs rather than in the user interface.
API has become essential to modern software development, allowing different software applications to communicate and share data. However, this increased connectivity also poses significant security challenges.
APIs can be vulnerable to attacks from malicious actors seeking to exploit them for their own purposes.
